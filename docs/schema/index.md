Schema Reference
================
The Social Finance Data Standard is maintained using JSON Schema. The Schema is the authoritative source for the specification, and defines the structure of an individual deal so that it can be annotated and validated.

When publishing an individual deal or a number of deals, these deals should be packaged into a single, valid JSON file.

These field names for properties are important for ensuring that data is published in a machine-readable format. The title gives a human-readable form, with information about each of the properties included in description.

The [full JSON schema](../_static/docson/index.html#../schema.json) is described below.

```eval_rst

.. jsonschema:: ../../schema/schema.json
